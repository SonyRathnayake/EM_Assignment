#Instructions to run#
> npm install
> react-native run-android

#Back-end#
> navigate to firebase/functions
> npm install
> firebase login
> firebase init (choose cloud functions)
> "firebase deploy" to deploy backend (Optional, as it has already been deployed.)

PS. Firebase deployment is not a mandate, as deploying cloud functions is a paid process.
You can simply import the Postman Collections and test the existing endpoints.
